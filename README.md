# Air-Quality-Discord-Bot

This Discord bot allows you to access the air quality data of any location in the US. To query the bot, use the command '.air' followed by a zip code. The bot will then reply with a Discord embed detailing the location's AQI(air quality index), highest pollutant, name of the reporting area, and the status or rating of the air quality. The status variable is set to "good," "moderate," "unhealthy for sensitive groups," "unhealthy," "very unhealthy," or "hazardous." These ratings are all derived from the value of the AQI.

This project began after the Canadian wildfires engulfed my city in smoke for several days. I realized I could develop a program that makes air quality data easily accessible for myself and my environmentally conscious friends, so I did just that.
